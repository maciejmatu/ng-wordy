# Ng-Wordy

This application is created for learning pourposes. We decided to create it using MEAN stack.

## Philosophy
Front-end and back-end will be separated. Backend will work as a REST Api, and frontend will be a dynamic web application.

## Git Workflow
Currently we are using the [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

## Frontend
In frontend part of this application we use:
- angular
- angular-cli
- redux
- ng2-redux
- typescript
- bootstrap
- rxjs

## Backend
In backend part we use:
- node.js
- express
- mongodb
- typescript

## Typescript
We try to follow this typescript style guide, to maintain clean code:<br>
[Basarat Typescript Style Guide](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/styleguide/styleguide.html)

## Development
In order to develop application, one must run "npm start" from 'client' and from 'server' directory.
It will start frontend and backend development servers that talk to each other.

Client will be run on htpp://localhost:9000
Server will be run on http://localhost:9001
